SSTPClient, Linux SSTP client

What is SSTP ?

Wikipedia says:
"Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP) is a form of VPN tunnel that provides a
mechanism to transport PPP or L2TP traffic through an SSL 3.0 channel. SSL
provides transport-level security with key-negotiation, encryption and traffic
integrity checking. The use of SSL over TCP port 443 allows SSTP to pass through
virtually all firewalls and proxy servers."

What is SSTPClient ?

A Linux client to establish VPN communication with SSTP server. Since SSTP is
only a wrapper over PPP communication, pppd (http://ppp.samba.org/) MUST be
installed.

Features:
- IPv4 support (v6 to be tested)
- HMAC-256 support (HMAC-160 to be tested)
- provides a Wireshark SSTP dissector

Installing Wireshark SSTP:

* Download Wireshark source from http://www.wireshark.org and un-tar archive
* Add "dissectors/packet-sstp.c" in DISSECTOR_SRC section inside
  `epan/CMakeLists.txt` file
* Add "packet-sstp.c" in DISSECTOR_SRC section inside
  `epan/dissectors/Makefile.common` file
* In wireshark/ directory, execute :
{{{
   $ ./autogen.sh
   $ ./configure --with-ssl
   $ make
}}}
* You now have a SSTP-compliant Wireshark version (a simple SSTP negociation
  PCAP file is provided in misc/ directory)

Session example:
- first you need your server PEM-formatted CA file. It can usually be obtained
  like this:
  -> Go to http://<server>/certsrv
     -> Click on "Download a CA certificate, certificate chain, or CRL" link
     -> Select "Base64" as "Encoding method" option
     -> Click on "Download CA certificate" link

- un-tar and compile sstpclient
{{{
$ tar xf sstpclient.tar.gz
$ ./configure && make
}}}

- execute
{{{
$ sudo ./sstpclient -s server -c server.crt -U user -P pass
[!] Using default value: 443.
[!] Using default value: /usr/sbin/pppd.
